# Data-Visualization-Project
 A simple Python data visualization project. I explored salary data and visualizes insights about job titles, salaries, company ratings, and other features. The following visualizations were created using Python and libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
## Visualizations

### 1. Bar Plot: Top 10 Job Titles by Salary
This bar plot highlights the top 10 job titles with the highest salaries in the dataset.

## Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project analyzes supermarket sales data and includes the following visualizations:
- **Bar Plot:** Total sales by city (`barplot_city_sales.png`).
- **Line Plot:** Daily sales trends (`lineplot_daily_sales.png`).
- **Heatmap:** Correlation matrix (`heatmap_correlation.png`).

The analysis script is in `supermarket_analysis.py`.
